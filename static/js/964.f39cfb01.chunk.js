My diverse range of experiences and expertise includes internships at top companies such as Optum (a Fortune 5 company) and leadership roles in academic and professional organizations. Previously, I worked on the automation of verification for medical provider information at Optum, the perceptions team at CMU CAR, and researched low-level laser communication systems at Irvine CubeSat. I am deeply interested in the power of technology to solve problems and make a positive impact on the world.

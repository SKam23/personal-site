# Intro

I am a Senior (year 4/4) Electrical Engineering & Computer Science student at [UC Berkleey](https://www.berkeley.edu/), Berkeley, CA. I have 1 year of work experience across my time at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) (11 months ongoing) and [Intel](https://www.intel.com/) (3 months) in Software Engineering.

I am a go-getter that enjoys problem solving and community building. Most of all, I am excited to learn more about the world of technology and how it can connect people.

# Currently

I am working as a Software Engineering Intern at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) and getting ready to start my final year at UC Berkeley. My current interests are Computer Vision and Distributed Systems.

# I like

- Electronic Dance Music (House & Techno), currently listening to [Adra](https://adra.bandcamp.com/album/fear-is-the-mind-killer)
- Cooking
- European Art History 
- Anime
- Working Out

# Fun facts

- I learned to play chess all by myself and played nationally in the USCF from 2015-2017.
- I type very fast. I have an average WPM of 136, and my highest WPM is 163.
- I attended my first hackathon in 2019, but never presented (we all chickened!).
- I used to play the piano. I wish I continued playing because I find it fun now, but I definitely don't miss the practice sessions.
- I have a lot of side projects that have never survived and live in the dark corner called _private repos_.

# I dream of

- visiting all the continents (except Antarctica).
- speaking all languages.
- being better than you at Smash Ultimate.
- you not asking for example side projects because I am far too embarassed by their progress.

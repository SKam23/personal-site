## System Software Engineer (Bit Alchemist)
- I am a System Software Engineer based in the Bay Area. Currently, I'm at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) (9/21-) working on Vehicle System Software. On the side, I'm finishing up my degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). 
- Previously, I worked on Cyber-physical IoT systems at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/), Robotics Cloud at [CloudMinds](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cloudminds-technologies/), and Low Band Communication System at [Irvine Cubesat](https://www.irvinecubesat.org/) (In short: Autonomous Electric Vehicles, Industrial Robotics, Cloud Computing, and Satellites.)
- I'm interested in building a sustainable future and decentralized web. I am a mission-driven creative problem solver. I live for designing customer-centric products experiences.

# I like:
- Surfing. I ride a 9ft long board and my favorite surf spot is "Old Man's" at San-Onofre (Right next to the closed Nuclear plants). One day, I will go on my [Endless Summer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060371/) in search of the perfect wave. 
- Electronic Dance Music (House and Techno). I'm currently listening to [Adra](https://adra.bandcamp.com/album/fear-is-the-mind-killer).
- Running. 
- Eating. Sharing food is my love language. Better if it's homemade.
# Fun facts:
- I grew up in Beijing and moved to the United States for high school. I played on the football team and initially joined thinking it was actual football (Soccer).
# I dream of
- starting my own restaurant one day.

# Intro

I am a Computer Science student at Carnegie Mellon University with over half a decade of experience in the field. My diverse range of experiences and expertise includes internships at top companies such as Optum (a Fortune 5 company) and leadership roles in academic and professional organizations. Previously, I worked on the automation of verification for medical provider information at Optum, the perceptions team at CMU CAR, and researched low-level laser communication systems at Irvine CubeSat. I am deeply interested in the power of technology to solve problems and make a positive impact on the world. Throughout my studies, I have learned a wide range of programming languages and technologies, and I am always looking for new opportunities to challenge myself and grow my skills and knowledge.

# Currently

I am an incoming SDE intern at Amazon in Seattle for the summer of 2023. Currently, I am a second-year Computer Science student at CMU who is struggling to decide on a concentration (Systems, ML, or Robotics).
